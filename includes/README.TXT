Thank you for downloading MusicMan, a lightweight cross-platform music player
and library manager written in Java.

MusicMan is Copyright Ian Renton 2009, and is released under the terms of the
GNU General Public Licence version 3, which can be found in the file
LICENCE.TXT included with this distribution.

More information about the application, including its source code, can be found
at the following website:


               http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/musicman


MusicMan requires the Java runtime, version 6 or above, to be installed on your
system.  You can get it from http://java.sun.com .  Windows users should do just
that.  Linux users should get it through their normal distribution channels (on
Debian/Ubuntu, I believe "sudo apt-get install sun-jre6-bin" should do the
trick.  Mac OS and Solaris users have Java preinstalled as part of their OS
distribution.

To run MusicMan, just double-click MusicMan.jar.  From a command line, run
"java -jar ./MusicMan.jar".

I hope you enjoy using this software as much as I enjoyed writing it.
